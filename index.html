<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>This webpage
contains materials coming from the field methods class at University of
Troms&oslash; in 2007, conducted on the Khoe language Shwakhwe
(Shua). I would like to thank Molapisi Kagisano who provided all of the
data: he bears no responsibility for errors contained herein.<br>

<br>
Migration of this material to Github is a work in progress: you may
encounter errors that I'm fixing, that I can't fix (technical stuff),
or that I don't know about. Being a migration of an existing work,
sound file links are via "a href=" and not via a Java call, so don't
bother playing sounds on a phone, or certain browsers (I don't know
which ones fail). <br>
<br>

Phonetics and spelling: not yet written.
